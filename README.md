## Key Features

- **Interactive Map**: The application offers an interactive map interface where users can explore different cities and landmarks.
- **React Leaflet Integration**: Leveraging the React Leaflet library, the map provides intuitive navigation functionalities and displays city information.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is designed with a component-based architecture, allowing for modular development and easy maintenance.
- **State Management**: State management techniques, including React's context API, are employed to ensure scalability and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Seamless Navigation**: React Router is utilized for seamless navigation within the application, enabling users to easily traverse between different sections and views.
- **Dynamic Functionality**: React Hooks are used to create dynamic functionality, allowing users to share specific locations and experiences with others.

## Logic and Implementation

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is structured into reusable components, such as Map, CityDetails, NavigationBar, etc., to promote code reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: State is managed efficiently using React's useState and useContext hooks, allowing components to access and update shared state data.
- **React Leaflet Integration**: The React Leaflet library is seamlessly integrated into the application, enabling the rendering of interactive maps with custom markers and overlays.
- **Dynamic Functionality with Hooks**: React Hooks, such as useState and useEffect, are used to create dynamic functionality, such as updating city details based on user interactions and fetching data from external APIs.
- **Routing with React Router**: React Router is employed to handle navigation between different pages and views within the application, ensuring a smooth and cohesive user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core framework powering the frontend development, providing a component-based architecture for building interactive user interfaces.
- **React Leaflet**: Utilized for integrating interactive maps into the application, enabling users to explore cities and landmarks.
- **React Router**: Employed for managing navigation within the application, facilitating seamless transitions between different sections and views.
- **React Hooks**: Utilized for creating dynamic functionality and managing state within functional components.
- **Context API**: Leveraged for state management across components, ensuring data consistency and scalability.

## Getting Started

To run the Travel Tracking React Application locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd travel-tracking-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Future Enhancements
